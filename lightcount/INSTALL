  INSTALL (LightCount IP traffic counter)                wjd, oct 2008
========================================================================

  This document describes how to install LightCount. Execute the
following steps.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Compiling the daemon
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  After downloading the latest version, you need to compile the daemon.
Go into the daemon/ directory and type 'make':
$ cd daemon
$ make

  This might produce errors. Either you're not running a Debian/Linux or
Ubuntu/Linux system or you're missing one of the following packages:
+ gcc (the compiler) and make (the build tool)
+ libc6-dev (the standard development libraries)
+ libmysqlclient-dev (the mysql client libraries)

  Install them and try again.

  Note that it will most likely compile on any other GNU/Linux
installation. Only the packages you need might be a bit different.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting up the database
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Currently you can only select storage_my.c to store the data in a
MySQL database. I assume that you have one set up and know how to do
basic thing like running the CREATE TABLE script in the lightcount
root directory. Do it:
$ mysql YOUR_CREDENTIALS < lightcount.storage_my.sql

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Setting up the configuration file
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Both the daemon and the interface require a simple configuration file.
Copy the lightcount.conf.example to lightcount.conf and supply the MySQL
credentials you used in the previous step.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Running the daemon
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  If the compile step went like it should, you have three daemon
executables: lightcount, lightcount.slow and lightcount.fast. They take
two arguments: the interface name (or 'any') and the configuration file
name. Example:
# ./lightcount eth0 ../lightcount.conf

  Hit the common CTRL-C combination to stop it.

  If you want extensive help, use the -h option:
# ./lightcount -h | more

  The difference between the three versions is the amount of debugging
output they produce and the level of optimization that the compiler
performed.
+ lightcount.slow produces lots of output. Run it on localhost only or
  supply a different interface than the one you're connecting from.
+ lightcount produces a little less output.
+ lightcount.fast produces only error and warning output. It is also
  the most heavily optimized. Run this on your production system when
  you know that it works.

  (There is currently no daemonize feature. Run it in a screen(1) when
you're done testing.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reading the data
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  In the interface directory you will find graph.py. Use it to generate
a pretty graph of your data. Run it with -h to see all available
options. It reads the same configuration file as the daemon (see the -c
option). graph.py was tested with python (2.4/2.5), pytz (python-tz),
matplotlib (python-matplotlib) and MySQLdb (python-mysqldb).

  The directory also contains modpython.py, an example script for
(apache2) mod_python.

  Time zone support seems broken with python2.4.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reading the data by hand
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Of course there are a lot more things you can do with the data.
storage_my.c stores the data in the MySQL `sample_tbl`. The `unixtime`
column denotes the sampling begin time. The other column names speak for
themselves. Use the built-in FROM_UNIXTIME, INET_ATON and INET_NTOA
MySQL functions to convert to/from readable forms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Limiting the stored IP addresses
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  By default, the storage_my.c daemon module stores any IP address it
sees. You can limit this by editing the `ip_range_tbl` MySQL table. When
inserting samples in the database, it checks if the IP it is about to
insert is in range for either `node_id` NULL or the machines specific
node_id.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tweaking the daemon
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There are a couple of options you can change. These options are
hardcoded preprocessor defines instead of variables to squeeze every
last bit of performance out of the program.

  When you're ready to tweak, check out ./lightcount -h to see what you
can change.
