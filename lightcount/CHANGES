========================================================================

  This document lists the changes of lightcount since SVN revision 49.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Changelog
------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ 090702: Added a 3 hour period (the one hour graph has only 12 data
          points).
+ 090702: Added 'graphstat' as alias for 'statgraph' in trafutil.
+ 090609: Renamed lightcount.py to trafutil.py to not conflict with the
          lightcount interface library directory.
+ 090605: Added dashed 95 percentile line for the estimate of the
          current month.
+ 090521: Reduce database size by using smaller integers. Revert r42 if
          you have that much traffic that your values overflow. (MySQL
          sets them to INT_MAX on overflow, so it's easy to see.)
+ 090409: Proper handling of the keyboard interrupt (SIGINT) in the
          lightcount.py interface.
+ 090409: Replaced the "FIXME" in the graph legend with numbers. You're
          free to print the query out-of-band, using numbers starting at
          one.
+ 090409: Fixed issue with drawing of zero-values where no values should
          be drawn (in newer numpy versions).
+ 090330: Added serialize-to-csv support in lightcount.data.
+ 090330: Changed the graph.py interface to lightcount.py and changed
          the interface a bit. It now allows for csv-serialization
          through the 'dump' command.
